Today we tried to communicate with the drones, but it didn't go as planned, only 2 grouos got their drones to fly, while the others didn't even get connected or up in the air.

What we will need to do is troubleshoot our problems & determine what caused these problems.

The main thing we do is that we go into a program to be able to communicate with the drones, but we have to get in contact with the drones first by connecting, which is harder than it seems, then we will experiment with the drone, & the types of commands we are capable of doing.
