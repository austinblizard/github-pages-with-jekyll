This is my fourth blog post!

For a few weeks in Coding one, we have been working on our drone backend project. We are coding the drone to be able to define-command keys, add directions as to what we want the drone in preparation for the drone course race here in a few weeks. Right now we are creating & finishing up a command input tool, & we have taken measurements for the loop that will be used during the course. The loop is approximately ten inches tall & nine inches wide, which is a little bigger than the drone, but we have also been working on designing a new possible loop solution to make it easier & more accessible for the drone to be able to fly through without any problems. We have discussed either designing a new base with a 3D printer or just making a whole new loop that maybe isn't a circle & instead is a square or had just a bigger loop for the drone to fly seamlessly through & continue through the course.
