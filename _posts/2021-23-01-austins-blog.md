Frontend developement in my own words I think is changing data to an interface, using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, so people can look at & interact with the data. 

What I've learned from the pinboard project is how I can link pictures to certain areas, as well as being able to change the colors of the background, & the type of font that you would want to be used.

I want to just try to overall imrpove myself in the course & expand my knowledge in coding.
